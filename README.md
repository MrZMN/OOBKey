Our team is prepared to provide all relevant materials regarding the user study. This includes both the developed software and the data collected from the study (in accordance with the ethics committees associated with this work).

The directory is as follows:
- Software in our prototype
	- IMD (Arduino)
        - Rotate and Pair
        - Tap and Pair
    - Smartphone app
    	- Rotate and Pair
        - Tap and Pair
- Data from user study

It is noteworthy that the smartphone apps are provided as APK files to facilitate testing for reviewers. Certain functionalities, such as the BLE connection with the pacemaker, have been temporarily disabled. This ensures that the apps are plug-and-play and do not need an additional Arduino device for testing. We will also release the source code in the final published version.
